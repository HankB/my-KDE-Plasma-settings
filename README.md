# my-KDE-Plasma-settings

Exploration and hopefully solution for saving/restoring/migrating settings.

## Motivation

KDE Plasma (KDE for brevity) provides a lot of configuration options and I have leveraged many of those to tailor my desktop environment to my liking. This builds into muscle memory and I find that when some things are not set, I get into trouble. For example "focus follows mouse" is something I cannot unbind from my finger tips. When it is absent, I find myself typing into the wrong application as I mouse around from window to window.

## Strategy

After doing a bit of searching on this, it seems that this is not as simple as I had expected. I see comments that indicate the KDE configuration files are, um ... scattered. There are also suggestions that they change dynamically and can be overwritten when logging out (e.g. using something other than the settings application should be done when not logged in.) It's obvious that the first step should be to collect information on this topic.
